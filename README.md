### The Lockdown Lounge
Welcome to the Lockdown Lounge! This website forum has been created for you to share some stories or jokes with everybody else bored and stuck inside. The aim of the website is to give people some space to unwind and spent some of that free time looking at how other people have managed to get through it all. 

The users can create their own account and use this to comment on peoples stories or jokes. They can also post their own content is they're logged in. If they're not registered, they will only be allowed to view the content. Not comment or add their own stuff. This is to encourage people coming back to the website. The user can also view their own content on their profile page, along with the account information. 

The website only currently has the basic functionality which allows people to do the above. There are more features which can be added to the website.
