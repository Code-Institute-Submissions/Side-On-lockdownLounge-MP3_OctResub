# Milestone Project 3

## Backend Development

### The Lockdown Lounge
Welcome to the Lockdown Lounge! This website forum has been created for you to share some stories or jokes with everybody else bored and stuck inside. The aim of the website is to give people some space to unwind and spent some of that free time looking at how other people have managed to get through it all. 

The users can create their own account and use this to comment on peoples stories or jokes. They can also post their own content is they're logged in. If they're not registered, they will only be allowed to view the content. Not comment or add their own stuff. This is to encourage people coming back to the website. The user can also view their own content on their profile page, along with the account information. 

The website only currently has the basic functionality which allows people to do the above. There are more features which can be added to the website.

### User experience

#### New user coming to the website to browse
The new user will be taken to the index page and there is a small amount of text. As this is only a forum page, I haven't gone for large images or things like that, as it's purely user content based. 
They will be explained what the website is and where to go to find stories and jokes. They'll also be told they need to be signed up to leave comments or content. Links are on the page to take the user to the relevant page.

#### New user wanting to create a story
The user can go to the story page on the navigation bar at the top. If they are a mobile user, there is a burger icon in the top left corner for them to click on and the other pages will show on there. When they get to the page, they will be reminded that they need to register for an account before they can add a story. The Add Story button is only visible to users who have an account and are signed in.

#### New user wanting to comment on a story
As above the user will be told if they want to comment on a story, they'll have to register an account. They can then go to the stories pages and find a story they want to comment on.

#### New user wanting to look at jokes
The user is firstly taken to the home page where the website function is explained. They are given two options to get to the jokes page. They can either click on the jokes anchor tag, or go to the 'Jokes' link found in the navbar. 

#### New user wanting to comment on a joke
This is the same process as the user wanting to comment on a joke. They are told to register an account before doing so and are then able to comment on the joke.

#### New user wanting to add their own joke
Same process as the user wanting to create a story, then will need to go to the joke page after having registered their account.

#### New user wanting to sign in and register an account
This will be made clear is the user wants to add any content to the website. They will be given a link to the register page on each page of the website to make it easier for them to find, it also encourages them to create an account. This page is kept simple and the user only needs to input basic details to create their account.

#### User wanting to look at the stories they've added
This is after the user has signed into their account. They are then shown the Profile navigation tab. They can go onto this page and are taken to the 'Stories' tab which shows all of the stories they've created.

#### User wanting to edit a story they've added
This user can do this by either finding their story and clicking (hover on desktop) on the small green circle. This opens up and there is a yellow icon whih shows a pencil and a square. I chose this icon because it looks like the most comment icon when editing something. The user is then taken to another page for their story and the story title and content fields are pre-populated with the original story contents. They can then click on the edit button and their story will be edited. They will then be taken back to the stories page.
