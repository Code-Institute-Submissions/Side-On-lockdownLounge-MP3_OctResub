#### Validators
To ensure all code uses correct syntax and doesnt 

[WC3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - All HTML pages were tested. 'Bad Value' errors created by the Jinji code, however there were some errors which have been subsequently fixed, shown in the HTML testing table.

[Python Validator](http://pep8online.com/) - Copied app.py code into the validator and passed tests. There were some indentations to fix initally. Fixed this and tested again and it passed.

[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - css stylesheet code was copied into the validator. There were two errors, one was 'line-break: 20px', this was written in error and removed. The other was a border style which is no longer used.

[JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com/) - Passed code into the validator. The errors shown were undefined variables '$', this is used with jquery and appears to not be recognised by the validator.
